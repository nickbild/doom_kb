There is no quicker way to get your retro gaming fix than by pressing The Doomsday Button. One press of this big red button launches a game of Doom on a nearby vintage PC.

This project was inspired by John Park's [Doom keyboard](https://www.hackster.io/news/keyboard-warriors-060948232ef6), which launches a source port of Doom on a modern computer.
