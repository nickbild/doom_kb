# Doomsday Button

There is no quicker way to get your retro gaming fix than pressing the Doomsday Button.

One press of the big red button launches a game of Doom on a nearby vintage PC.

This project was inspired by John Park's [Doom keyboard](https://www.hackster.io/news/keyboard-warriors-060948232ef6), which launches a source port of Doom on a modern computer.
